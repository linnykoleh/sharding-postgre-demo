# Horizontal Sharding

## Create 3 docker containers: postgresql-b, postgresql-b1, postgresql-b2

## Setup horizontal/vertical sharding as itâ€™s described in this lesson and  with alternative tool (citus, pgpool-|| postgres-xl)

## Insert 1 000 000 rows into books.

## Measure performance for reads and writes.

## Do the same without sharding.

## Compare performance of 3 cases (without sharding, FDW, and approach of your choice).
